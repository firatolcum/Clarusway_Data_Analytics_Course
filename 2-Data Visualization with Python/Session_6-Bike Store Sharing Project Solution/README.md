# BIKE DEMAND VISUALIZATION CAPSTONE PROJECT
Welcome to "Bike Demand Visualization Project" which is the capstone project of Data Visualization Lessons . As you know recently, free or affordable access to bicycles has been provided for short-distance trips in an urban area as an alternative to motorized public transport or private vehicles. Thus, it is aimed to reduce traffic congestion, noise and air pollution.

The aim of this project is to reveal the current patterns in the data by showing the historical data of London bike shares with visualization tools.

This will allow us to X-ray the data as part of the EDA process before setting up a machine learning model.
