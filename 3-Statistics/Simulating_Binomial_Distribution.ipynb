    "##### Simulating binomial distribution\n",
    "We are going to simulate binomial data. Binomial distributions are very useful for modeling different types of data, from drug treatment effectiveness to stock price trends.<br>\n",
    "Binomial events always have 2 possible outcomes, which we refer to as success and failure. The probability of a successful outcome is represented by the parameter p. For example, for the event of a coin toss using a fair coin, p would be 0.5.<br>\n",
    "There are lots of ways to do this. We could flip a coin a bunch of times and write down the results or we could use the random.binomial() method from the numpy library in Python.<br>\n",
    "To use the random.binomial() method, we have to tell it how many trials we want to simulate (n) and the probability of ‘success’ in a single trial (p), and how many experiments to run."
